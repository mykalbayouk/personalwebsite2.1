            I'm Michael J. Bayouk, a passionate software developer with a love for both front-end and back-end development.
            I enjoy creating software that is both functional and enjoyable to use, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies to refine my skills.
            I have a strong background in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, and I'm proficient in building scalable web applications.

            In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and watching animeâ€”recently,
            I've been enjoying Solo Leveling and Sakamato Days.
            I also play video games, with Marvel Rivals being a current favorite.
            Beyond that, I love reading, particularly the works of Osamu Dazai.
            Spending time with family and friends is important to me, whether it's watching a movie or grabbing sushi together.
